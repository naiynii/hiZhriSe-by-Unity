["Attention all passengers, please do not stand in the way of the entrance and exit of the platform. And…”]
An announcement in a train station familiar as every day. Coupled with people rushing in the morning.
Including...
Myxxe: *tap* *tap* *tap* huffhuff....
Young boy running up the stairs and quickly passed through many groups of people.
Myxxe: Just a little longer​.
Myxxe: Haaaa!!

And that was another day that he got on the train just in time. But it must be exchanged for morning exercise.
Myxxe: Huff...huff...oof It's almost too late.

—While the train was running. He is pondered as he hung on the railing.
Myxxe: Who did I dream about last night….It looked very strange.
Myxxe: Probably a result of less sleep. At this point, I'm even more blurry. Sigh...
Myxxe: Ummm...

He had goosebumps all over. And hurriedly turned to look around.

He walks through the city center. and quickly entered the alley and he entered the door of the back of some shop.
That's right, it's the shop where he's doing "Part-time".

Because…. Ahem, forget about it. Let's get back to the story.
Myxxe: *Bang!* Good morning! I'll go to the toilet first!
Assistant Manager: Ara~ Good morning~ You come early today.
He walked to the toilet without caring about the surroundings. And as soon as he unzipped his pants—
—I met a fluffy rabbit. It's between my d*ck. I don't know since when.
???: Ahhh~~ Your thighs and your d*ck are so soft.
