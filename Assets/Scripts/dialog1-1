But a word that seemed to be particularly loud and clear came out.
"...up...at"

“Get out of bed now! Do you know what time is it?!!!!!!"
He flinched unconsciously. Then he found his sister ---Mira, standing at the end of the bed.
Myxxe: What day is today? Mira-nee.
Mira: Monday. Dare to ask?!
He flinched again for the second time, two flinched, double flinched. ——Erm, it's a joke. :D
Then he got up and did a routine like the speed of light.
Mira: Sigh, really, let it be like this every time. Both waking up late….
Suddenly, a scream sound came from the bathroom.
Myxxe: AAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY LITTLE FINGERRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mira: ........and clumsy.
